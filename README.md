## Project Overview

The **Superstore Sales Forecasting & Optimization** project is a comprehensive, production-ready solution for predicting and optimizing sales in a retail environment. It covers the entire data science lifecycle:

- **End-to-end workflow:** Data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring
- **MLOps integration:** MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and automated retraining
- **Interactive dashboard:** Real-time KPIs, visualizations, and user-driven predictions via a Flask web app
- **Professional documentation:** Detailed markdown reports and stakeholder-ready presentations

This repository is designed for both technical and business users, providing actionable insights, robust code, and clear documentation.

## üìä Reports & Presentation

All professional documentation is in the `reports/` directory:
- `data_analysis_report.md`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `data_engineering_report.md`: Data cleaning & feature engineering
- `modeling_report.md`: Model selection, training, and MLflow tracking
- `mlops_deployment_report.md`: MLOps, dashboard, retraining, deployment
- `dashboard_visualization_report.md`: UI & visualization features
- `final_comprehensive_report.md`: Executive summary and synthesis
- `presentation.md`: Stakeholder presentation (Markdown, ready for slides)

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
3. **Review reports:**
   - Read all markdown reports in `reports/` for technical and business insights.
   - Use `presentation.md` for stakeholder meetings (convert to slides as needed).
4. **MLOps & retraining:**
   - Track experiments and models with MLflow (see `mlruns/` and dashboard MLOps page).
   - Retrain models using `src/retrain.py`.

## üîë Key Features
- **Full data science workflow:** From raw data to deployed model and dashboard
- **Interactive web app:** Real-time predictions and analytics
- **MLOps best practices:** Experiment tracking, versioning, and retraining
- **Professional documentation:** For both technical and non-technical audiences
