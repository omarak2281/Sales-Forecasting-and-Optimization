# Dashboard & Visualization Report

## 1. Dashboard Overview
The Superstore Sales Prediction dashboard is an interactive web application built with Flask (see `src/app.py`). It provides real-time visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, enabling users to explore sales, profit, quantity, profit margin, and year-over-year changes.

### Key Features

* Real-time data updates from `Superstore.xlsx`
* Dynamic computation of KPIs and tables through the dashboard API (`/api/dashboard_data`)
* Filtering by segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) with breakdowns by category, region, shipping mode, and product

## 2. User Experience
The dashboard is designed to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface, offering clear feedback and error messages if data is missing or filters are invalid.

### Key Benefits

* Single-page view of KPIs, category trends, top/bottom products, and regional sales
* Interactive updates based on user input (segment selection)
* Intuitive navigation and visualization layout

## 3. Visualizations
The dashboard features a range of visualizations to facilitate data exploration and insights.

### Visualization Types

* **KPIs:** Sales, Profit, Quantity, Profit Margin (with YoY trends)
* **Tables:** Category performance, top/bottom products
* **Charts:** Sales by region, shipping mode, and category
* **Map:** State-level sales distribution

### Data Sources
All visualizations are generated from the real Superstore dataset, ensuring up-to-date insights.

## 4. User Feedback and Monitoring
To ensure the dashboard meets user needs and expectations, we collect feedback through various channels.

### Feedback Mechanisms

* In-dashboard feedback form
* Regular user surveys
* Analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics)

### Monitoring and Evaluation
We continuously monitor dashboard performance and user engagement, using metrics such as:

* User retention and return rates
* Time spent on dashboard pages
* Filter and visualization usage

## 5. Improvements & Future Work
To further enhance the dashboard, we plan to:

* Add more advanced filters (e.g., by time period, state, or product sub-category)
* Integrate forecasting and anomaly detection analytics
* Enable exporting of dashboard views and automated reporting
